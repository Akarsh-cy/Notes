#### ***Thermal voltage***: 

An equivalent to ***temperature*** $V_t$=$\frac{T V_0}{11600}$  
#### ***Diffusion***:
Movement of charges due to gradient.  
E=$\frac{-dv}{dx}$   
  where dv->change in voltage and dx->change in distance.  
# P-N junction diode. 
When single silicon wafer is doped with pentavalent and trivalent impurities on either side a pn junction is formed.  
#important 
1. impurities are never solder they are always doped.  

When a trivalent impurity like boron is introduced into the silicon lattice.One electron of silicon is left non-bonded this creates a space/vacancy where a electron can be accepted and if it accepts it would result in a net -ve charge.  

#p_and_n_type_naming   
 
  - The terms p and n refer to the predominant charge carrier present on that side.
 - The p side is represented by -ve sign and holes which basically means the p side has positive charge carriers (holes) and if the holes are fixed then -ve charge will ne formed.
 -  The n side is represented by+ sign and electrons which means n side has negative charge carriers(electrons) and if it donates a positive charge will occur.  
#doping_concentrations 
1.  Lightly doped 1:$10^{12}$ to $10^{18}$ 
2. Moderately doped   1:$10^6$ 
3. Highly doped 1:$10^3$ 
 #convections 
 - moderate-> P/N
 - highly doped-> $P^+$ /$N^+$ 
 - lightly doped-> $P^-$/$N^-$   
 When the doped p and n sides are connected the electrons from n side diffuse towards the p side holes and vive versa. Due to this diffusion a charge gradient with +ve on n side and -ve on p side called the depletion region is formed. Due to the generated gradient further diffusion of charge carrier stops . The width of the depletion region depends on doping more doping increases charge carriers which produces a strong electric field making the region smaller in width.  

$W_d \propto \frac{1}{Doping}$   

The charge density inside the region is given by sinusoidal curve (-sin(x))
$\frac{d^2 v}{d x^2}$ =-$\frac{\rho}{E}$  
Where $\rho$ is the charge density of the depletion region.  

On double integrating we get :  
V= -$\int$ $\int$ $\frac{\rho}{E}$
